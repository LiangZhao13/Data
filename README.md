# Data for: A Multi-objective Optimization Based Path Planning Approach for Unmanned Surface Vehicles
This is the original data for the author's ariticle: *A Multi-objective Optimization Based Path Planning Approach for Unmanned Surface Vehicles*. Submitted to *Ships and Offshore Structures*. 

### Requirements:
MATLAB 2021a is preferred.\
The Navigational Toolbox package is required.

### How to use it?
To start using the data, run the file [plotres.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-Intelligent-Navigation-A-Sensor-based-Path-Planning-Approach-for-Unmanned-Surface-Vehicles/blob/main/plotres.m) to generate all the figures that related to the article.\
Run the file [energyConsume.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-Intelligent-Navigation-A-Sensor-based-Path-Planning-Approach-for-Unmanned-Surface-Vehicles/blob/main/energyConsume.m) to calculate the energy consumption for each case.\
Run the [appendix.m](https://github.com/LiangZhao13/Data-for-Intelligent-Navigation-A-Sensor-based-Path-Planning-Approach-for-Unmanned-Surface-Vehicles/blob/main/appendix.m) file, the results generated by the USV model simulations are presented.\
